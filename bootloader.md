If your system uses UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) 
for booting, and you have a separate EFI partition, you should mount the EFI partition before chrooting into your system to repair the bootloader.

Here's how you can mount the EFI partition:

Identify the EFI partition: You can use the lsblk command to list all the available partitions and identify the EFI partition. It is typically a small FAT32 partition labeled as "EFI System Partition" or "EFI".

Mount the EFI partition: Assuming the EFI partition is located at /dev/sdXY (where X is the drive letter and Y is the partition number), you can mount it to a temporary directory:

    sudo mkdir /mnt/boot/efi  # Create a mount point
    sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/boot/efi  # Mount the EFI partition

  Mounting the EFI partition is essential for repairing the bootloader on a UEFI system because the bootloader files reside in the EFI partition.
  By mounting it, you ensure that the bootloader repair commands operate on the correct partition

Mount Other Necessary Directories: After mounting the EFI partition, you need to mount other essential directories such as /dev, /proc, and /sys. This step ensures that your repair actions inside the chroot environment have access to the necessary system resources. You can do this using the following commands:

    sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
    sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
    sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys

Chroot into Your Installed System: Once you've mounted all the necessary directories, you can chroot into your installed system. This step changes the root directory to your installed system, allowing you to run commands as if you were booted into it:

    sudo chroot /mnt  # Change root to mounted system

Repair the Bootloader: After chrooting into your installed system, you can proceed to repair the bootloader using the appropriate commands for your bootloader. 
GRUB: Reinstall GRUB to the boot sector using 
           
    grub-install 
    update-grub
For Syslinux: 

     Reinstall Syslinux using syslinux-install_update -i -a -m.
Exit the Chroot Environment: After repairing the bootloader, exit the chroot environment:

    exit  # Exit the chroot environment

Unmount Partitions: Finally, unmount all the mounted partitions, including the EFI partition:

    sudo umount /mnt/boot/efi  # Unmount the EFI partition
    sudo umount /mnt/dev /mnt/proc /mnt/sys /mnt  # Unmount other directories

 Reboot: Reboot your computer to apply the changes and test if the bootloader issue has been resolved.

Following these steps should help you repair the bootloader on your Linux system after mounting the EFI partition. Make sure to replace /dev/sdXY with the correct partition identifier for your EFI partition.
