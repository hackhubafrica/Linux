To run your Python script with elevated privileges (sudo) without needing to manually use the sudo command each time, you can configure your system in a few ways. Here's how you can achieve this:
# Method 1: Using sudoers File
You can edit the sudoers file to allow your user to run the specific Python script without a password.

Open the sudoers file with visudo:
         
    sudo visudo

Add a line to allow your user to run the Python script without a password:

    yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/cli.py

Replace yourusername with your actual username and /path/to/cli.py with the full path to your script.

# Method 2: Creating an Alias

You can create a shell alias that automatically uses sudo when running your script.

Open your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .zshrc):
  
     nano ~/.bashrc

Add an alias for your script:

    alias runscriptelevated='sudo python /path/to/cli.py'

Reload the shell configuration file:

    source ~/.bashrc

# Method 3: Creating a Wrapper Script

You can create a small shell script that runs your Python script with sudo.

Create a new shell script:
  
    nano run_cli.sh

Add the following content to the script:

         #!/bin/bash
         sudo python /path/to/cli.py "$@"

Make the script executable:

    chmod +x run_cli.sh

Run the wrapper script instead of the Python script directly:

    ./run_cli.sh

# Method 4: Setting the SUID Bit (Not Recommended for Security Reasons)

Another approach is to set the SUID bit on the Python interpreter, but this is generally not recommended due to security risks.

Find the Python interpreter path:

    which python

Change the owner to root and set the SUID bit:

    sudo chown root:root /path/to/python
    sudo chmod u+s /path/to/python

Security Considerations

Editing sudoers file: Ensure you correctly edit the sudoers file using visudo to avoid syntax errors that can lock you out of sudo access.
Wrapper script: This is safer than setting the SUID bit on the Python interpreter, but be cautious about who can access and modify this script.
Aliases: Convenient but may not be suitable for all environments, especially when used in automated scripts.

Choose the method that best fits your security requirements and usage scenario. The sudoers file modification is a good balance between convenience and security for running specific scripts with elevated privileges.
